# This Python file will describe how to write 2000 lines of code in a single file.

# Let's start by defining a function. It won't do anything, but it will count as one of the lines.

def function():
    pass

# We'll also want to define some variables that we can use in our code.

variable1 = "Hello World!"
variable2 = 123
variable3 = [1,2,3]

# Now let's write some lines of code. We'll use a for loop to do this.

for i in range(2000):
    print(variable1, variable2, variable3)

# That's it! We've now written 2000 lines of code in one Python file.
